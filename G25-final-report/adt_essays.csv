"As online learning becomes more common and more and more resources are converted to digital form, some people have suggested that public libraries should be shut down and, in their place, everyone should be given an iPad with an e-reader subscription.
 

Proponents of this idea state that it will save local cities and towns money because libraries are expensive to maintain. They also believe it will encourage more people to read because they won’t have to travel to a library to get a book; they can simply click on what they want to read and read it from wherever they are. They could also access more materials because libraries won’t have to buy physical copies of books; they can simply rent out as many digital copies as they need.

However, it would be a serious mistake to replace libraries with tablets. First, digital books and resources are associated with less learning and more problems than print resources. A study done on tablet vs book reading found that people read 20-30% slower on tablets, retain 20% less information, and understand 10% less of what they read compared to people who read the same information in print. Additionally, staring too long at a screen has been shown to cause numerous health problems, including blurred vision, dizziness, dry eyes, headaches, and eye strain, at much higher instances than reading print does. People who use tablets and mobile devices excessively also have a higher incidence of more serious health issues such as fibromyalgia, shoulder and back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and muscle strain. I know that whenever I read from my e-reader for too long, my eyes begin to feel tired and my neck hurts. We should not add to these problems by giving people, especially young people, more reasons to look at screens.

Second, it is incredibly narrow-minded to assume that the only service libraries offer is book lending. Libraries have a multitude of benefits, and many are only available if the library has a physical location. Some of these benefits include acting as a quiet study space, giving people a way to converse with their neighbors, holding classes on a variety of topics, providing jobs, answering patron questions, and keeping the community connected. One neighborhood found that, after a local library instituted community events such as play times for toddlers and parents, job fairs for teenagers, and meeting spaces for senior citizens, over a third of residents reported feeling more connected to their community. Similarly, a Pew survey conducted in 2015 found that nearly two-thirds of American adults feel that closing their local library would have a major impact on their community. People see libraries as a way to connect with others and get their questions answered, benefits tablets can’t offer nearly as well or as easily.

While replacing libraries with tablets may seem like a simple solution, it would encourage people to spend even more time looking at digital screens, despite the myriad issues surrounding them. It would also end access to many of the benefits of libraries that people have come to rely on. In many areas, libraries are such an important part of the community network that they could never be replaced by a simple object."
"Malaria is an infectious disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through female Anopheles mosquitoes. Each year, over half a billion people will become infected with malaria, with roughly 80% of them living in Sub-Saharan Africa. Nearly half a million people die of malaria every year, most of them young children under the age of five. Unlike many other infectious diseases, the death toll for malaria is rising. While there have been many programs designed to improve access to malaria treatment, the best way to reduce the impact of malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa is to focus on reducing the number of people who contract the disease in the first place, rather than waiting to treat the disease after the person is already infected.
 

There are multiple drugs available to treat malaria, and many of them work well and save lives, but malaria eradication programs that focus too much on them and not enough on prevention haven’t seen long-term success in Sub-Saharan Africa. A major program to combat malaria was WHO’s Global Malaria Eradication Programme. Started in 1955, it had a goal of eliminating malaria in Africa within the next ten years. Based upon previously successful programs in Brazil and the United States, the program focused mainly on vector control. This included widely distributing chloroquine and spraying large amounts of DDT. More than one billion dollars was spent trying to abolish malaria. However, the program suffered from many problems and in 1969, WHO was forced to admit that the program had not succeeded in eradicating malaria. The number of people in Sub-Saharan Africa who contracted malaria as well as the number of malaria deaths had actually increased over 10% during the time the program was active.

One of the major reasons for the failure of the project was that it set uniform strategies and policies. By failing to consider variations between governments, geography, and infrastructure, the program was not nearly as successful as it could have been. Sub-Saharan Africa has neither the money nor the infrastructure to support such an elaborate program, and it couldn’t be run the way it was meant to. Most African countries don't have the resources to send all their people to doctors and get shots, nor can they afford to clear wetlands or other malaria prone areas. The continent’s spending per person for eradicating malaria was just a quarter of what Brazil spent. Sub-Saharan Africa simply can’t rely on a plan that requires more money, infrastructure, and expertise than they have to spare.

Additionally, the widespread use of chloroquine has created drug resistant parasites which are now plaguing Sub-Saharan Africa. Because chloroquine was used widely but inconsistently, mosquitoes developed resistance, and chloroquine is now nearly completely ineffective in Sub-Saharan Africa, with over 95% of mosquitoes resistant to it. As a result, newer, more expensive drugs need to be used to prevent and treat malaria, which further drives up the cost of malaria treatment for a region that can ill afford it.

Instead of developing plans to treat malaria after the infection has incurred, programs should focus on preventing infection from occurring in the first place. Not only is this plan cheaper and more effective, reducing the number of people who contract malaria also reduces loss of work/school days which can further bring down the productivity of the region.

One of the cheapest and most effective ways of preventing malaria is to implement insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs).  These nets provide a protective barrier around the person or people using them. While untreated bed nets are still helpful, those treated with insecticides are much more useful because they stop mosquitoes from biting people through the nets, and they help reduce mosquito populations in a community, thus helping people who don’t even own bed nets.  Bed nets are also very effective because most mosquito bites occur while the person is sleeping, so bed nets would be able to drastically reduce the number of transmissions during the night. In fact, transmission of malaria can be reduced by as much as 90% in areas where the use of ITNs is widespread. Because money is so scarce in Sub-Saharan Africa, the low cost is a great benefit and a major reason why the program is so successful. Bed nets cost roughly 2 USD to make, last several years, and can protect two adults. Studies have shown that, for every 100-1000 more nets are being used, one less child dies of malaria. With an estimated 300 million people in Africa not being protected by mosquito nets, there’s the potential to save three million lives by spending just a few dollars per person.

Reducing the number of people who contract malaria would also reduce poverty levels in Africa significantly, thus improving other aspects of society like education levels and the economy. Vector control is more effective than treatment strategies because it means fewer people are getting sick. When fewer people get sick, the working population is stronger as a whole because people are not put out of work from malaria, nor are they caring for sick relatives. Malaria-afflicted families can typically only harvest 40% of the crops that healthy families can harvest. Additionally, a family with members who have malaria spends roughly a quarter of its income treatment, not including the loss of work they also must deal with due to the illness. It’s estimated that malaria costs Africa 12 billion USD in lost income every year. A strong working population creates a stronger economy, which Sub-Saharan Africa is in desperate need of.  "
"As college sports continue to be hugely popular and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) brings in large amounts of revenue, people have revived the debate on whether college athletes should get paid.
 

There are many ways payments could work. They could be in the form of a free-market approach, where athletes are able to earn whatever the market is willing to pay them, it could be a set amount of money per athlete, or student athletes could earn income from endorsements, autographs, and control of their likeness, similar to the way top Olympians earn money.

Proponents of the idea believe that, because college athletes are the ones who are training, participating in games, and bringing in audiences, they should receive some sort of compensation for their work. If there were no college athletes, the NCAA wouldn’t exist, college coaches wouldn’t receive there (sometimes very high) salaries, and brands like Nike couldn’t profit from college sports. In fact, the NCAA brings in roughly $1 billion in revenue a year, but college athletes don’t receive any of that money in the form of a paycheck. Additionally, people who believe college athletes should be paid state that paying college athletes will actually encourage them to remain in college longer and not turn pro as quickly, either by giving them a way to begin earning money in college or requiring them to sign a contract stating they’ll stay at the university for a certain number of years while making an agreed-upon salary.  

Supporters of this idea point to Zion Williamson, the Duke basketball superstar, who, during his freshman year, sustained a serious knee injury. Many argued that, even if he enjoyed playing for Duke, it wasn’t worth risking another injury and ending his professional career before it even began for a program that wasn’t paying him. Williamson seems to have agreed with them and declared his eligibility for the NCAA draft later that year. If he was being paid, he may have stayed at Duke longer. In fact, roughly a third of student athletes surveyed stated that receiving a salary while in college would make them “strongly consider” remaining collegiate athletes longer before turning pro.

Paying athletes could also stop the recruitment scandals that have plagued the NCAA. In 2018, the NCAA stripped the University of Louisville's men's basketball team of its 2013 national championship title because it was discovered coaches were using sex workers to entice recruits to join the team. There have been dozens of other recruitment scandals where college athletes and recruits have been bribed with anything from having their grades changed, to getting free cars, to being straight out bribed. By paying college athletes and putting their salaries out in the open, the NCAA could end the illegal and underhanded ways some schools and coaches try to entice athletes to join.

People who argue against the idea of paying college athletes believe the practice could be disastrous for college sports. By paying athletes, they argue, they’d turn college sports into a bidding war, where only the richest schools could afford top athletes, and the majority of schools would be shut out from developing a talented team (though some argue this already happens because the best players often go to the most established college sports programs, who typically pay their coaches millions of dollars per year). It could also ruin the tight camaraderie of many college teams if players become jealous that certain teammates are making more money than they are.

They also argue that paying college athletes actually means only a small fraction would make significant money. Out of the 350 Division I athletic departments, fewer than a dozen earn any money. Nearly all the money the NCAA makes comes from men’s football and basketball, so paying college athletes would make a small group of men--who likely will be signed to pro teams and begin making millions immediately out of college--rich at the expense of other players.

Those against paying college athletes also believe that the athletes are receiving enough benefits already. The top athletes already receive scholarships that are worth tens of thousands per year, they receive free food/housing/textbooks, have access to top medical care if they are injured, receive top coaching, get travel perks and free gear, and can use their time in college as a way to capture the attention of professional recruiters. No other college students receive anywhere near as much from their schools.

People on this side also point out that, while the NCAA brings in a massive amount of money each year, it is still a non-profit organization. How? Because over 95% of those profits are redistributed to its members’ institutions in the form of scholarships, grants, conferences, support for Division II and Division III teams, and educational programs. Taking away a significant part of that revenue would hurt smaller programs that rely on that money to keep running.

While both sides have good points, it’s clear that the negatives of paying college athletes far outweigh the positives. College athletes spend a significant amount of time and energy playing for their school, but they are compensated for it by the scholarships and perks they receive. Adding a salary to that would result in a college athletic system where only a small handful of athletes (those likely to become millionaires in the professional leagues) are paid by a handful of schools who enter bidding wars to recruit them, while the majority of student athletics and college athletic programs suffer or even shut down for lack of money. Continuing to offer the current level of benefits to student athletes makes it possible for as many people to benefit from and enjoy college sports as possible."
"The debate over athletes’ use of performance-enhancing
substances is getting more complicated as biotechnologies such
as gene therapy become a reality. The availability of these new
methods of boosting performance will force us to decide what we
value most in sports—displays of physical excellence developed
through hard work or victory at all costs. For centuries, spectators
and athletes have cherished the tradition of fairness in sports.
While sports competition is, of course, largely about winning, it is
also about the means by which a player or team wins. Athletes who
use any type of biotechnology give themselves an unfair advantage
and disrupt the sense of fair play, and they should be banned from
competition.
Researchers are experimenting with techniques that could
manipulate an athlete’s genetic code to build stronger muscles or
increase endurance. Searching for cures for diseases like Parkinson’s
and muscular dystrophy, scientists at the University of Pennsylvania
have created “Schwarzenegger mice,” rodents that grew largerthan-normal muscles after receiving injections with a gene that
stimulates growth protein. The researchers also found that a
combination of gene manipulation and exercise led to a 35%
increase in the strength of rats’ leg muscles (Lamb 13)
Such therapies are breakthroughs for humans suffering from
muscular diseases; for healthy athletes, they could mean new world
records in sports involving speed and endurance—but at what
cost to the integrity of athletic competition? The International
Olympic Committee’s World Anti-Doping Agency has become so
alarmed about the possible effects of new gene technology on
athletic competition that it has banned the use of gene therapies
and urged researchers to devise a test for detecting genetic
modification (Lamb 13).
Some bioethicists argue that this next wave of performance
enhancement is an acceptable and unavoidable feature of
competition. As Dr. Andy Miah, who supports the regulated use of
gene therapies in sports, claims, “The idea of the naturally perfect
athlete is romantic nonsense. . . . An athlete achieves what he or
she achieves through all sorts of means—technology, sponsorship,
support and so on” (qtd. in Rudebeck). Miah, in fact, sees athletes’
imminent turn to genetic modification as “merely a continuation
of the way sport works; it allows us to create more extraordinary
performances” (Rudebeck). Miah’s approval of “extraordinary
performances” as the goal of competition reflects our culture’s
tendency to demand and reward new heights of athletic
achievement. The problem is that achievement nowadays
increasingly results from biological and high-tech intervention
rather than strictly from hard work.
Better equipment, such as aerodynamic bicycles and fiberglass
poles for pole vaulting, have made it possible for athletes to
record achievements unthinkable a generation ago. But athletes
themselves must put forth the physical effort of training and
practice—they must still build their skills—even in the murky area
of legal and illegal drug use (Jenkins D11). There is a difference
between the use of state-of-the-art equipment and drugs and the
modification of the body itself. Athletes who use medical technology
to alter their bodies can bypass the hard work of training by
taking on the powers of a machine. If they set new records this
way, we lose the opportunity to witness sports as a spectacle of
human effort and are left marveling at scientific advances, which
have little relation to the athletic tradition of fair play.
Such a tradition has long defined athletic competition.
Sports rely on equal conditions to ensure fair play, from regulations
that demand similar equipment to referees who evenhandedly
apply the rules to all participants. If the rules that guarantee an
even playing field are violated, competitors and spectators alike
are deprived of a sound basis of comparison on which to judge
athletic effort and accomplishment. When major league baseball
rules call for solid-wood bats, the player who uses a corked bat
enhances his hitting statistics at the expense of players who use
regulation equipment. When Ben Johnson tested positive for
steroids after setting a world record in the 100-meter dash in the
1988 Olympics, his “achievement” devalued the intense training that
his competitors had undergone to prepare for the event—and the
International Olympic Committee responded by stripping Johnson of
his medal and his world record. Likewise, athletes who use gene
therapy to alter their bodies and enhance their performance will
create an uneven playing field. 
If we let athletes alter their bodies through biotechnology, we
might as well dispense with the human element altogether. Instead
of watching the 100-meter dash to see who the fastest runner in
the world is, we might just as well watch the sprinters mount
motorcycles and race across the finish line. The absurdity of such an
example, however, points to the damage that we will do to sports if
we allow these therapies. Thomas Murray, chair of the ethics advisory
panel for the World Anti-Doping Agency, says he hopes, not too
optimistically, for an “alternative future . . . where we still find
meaning in great performances as an alchemy of two factors, natural
talents . . . and virtues” (qtd. in Jenkins D11).
Unless we are willing to organize separate sporting events
and leagues—an Olympics, say, for athletes who have opted for a
boost from the test tube and another for athletes who have chosen
to keep their bodies natural—we should ask from our athletes that
they dazzle us less with extraordinary performance and more with
the fruits of their hard work."
"Positive connections with older generations can enrich our lives. Even
though you may think otherwise, it is true.
 Some younger generations may say that older generations are ‘stupid’ or
‘un cool’. But I say otherwise. For lack of better terms, old people can tell us
things our parents can’t. They were there durring the war. They saw the first
T.V.’s. A few of them remember the first cars, and who could forget sliced bread.
These older generations can teach us from their past life experiences, thus
enriching our lives.
 I once had a friend who was kicked out of his parents home. He tried
staying with friends whos parents would let him stay. After about a week he
decided to go to his grandma’s house. His grandma is really cool. She would sit
there and joke with us. She would make us brownies and cook us dinner. His
grandma talked some sense into him and got him to clean up his act. She got
him to do what was best and move back to his parents house.
 To conclude, older generations can help us learn valuable lessons. They
are not just some ‘old fart’, but however, only enrich our lives if we aproach them
with a positive attitude."
"With positive connections with older geration can enrich our lives in many may,
we can learn from their experences.
With older generations like our grandparents we can learn about our families
past, how our parents used to act at our age, how the world used to be, how the
world has changed sence their time as a young person. Older generations I think
can tell the best stories because of their experiences in life, and the practice they
have had.
Older generations have a lot to offer still, they are not all used up because of
their age, they still have lots to offer us. They can show us from their mistakes
from the pass, so we will not do, and can learn from them. They are one of the
funnest age groups there so out of the loop its funny, when you see them try to
sue the “in language” you just have to laugh because they sound so akward
doing it. Even when they tell their old corny jokes. They are not really funny, but
they laugh so hard after they tell them they just make you burst out laughing.
When you have no one to talk to, there always their waiting for you. They always
try to fix our problem, they care for us very much. They will always have time to
listen to you, to go hang out with you. If you do not have a connection with your
parents, you usually do with the grandparents, they treat you like on of theirs.
Just because older generations may be slow and crippled doesn’t mean they
don’t have any uses. They’re people just like us with needs and wants. We can
learn from their life experiences, and learn from them, they can teach us to be
better people inside. They enrich our lives every day, with the little tings they do
for us each and"
"Positive connections with older generations allows people to enrich their
lives in ways nothing else can. Positive connections can allow people to avoid
certain hardships as well as make better decisions. Elderly people can offer
advice and insight that is more useful than that found anywhere else.
 Firstly, Talking to someone of an older generation will quickly reveal some
excellent advice that can be very easily applied to your own life. Only a person
who has experienced hardships first hand will be able to offer the kind of advice
which may one day save you from bankruptcy or save you from making a terrible
mistake which may cost you your life. A wise man once told me, “Don’t marry
until you have enough money and a house to live in.” Those are words which
rang true and may one day save me from a world of trouble. Only a person with
experience can offer this kind of advice.
 Secondly, Listening to the stories of past accomplishments of elderly
people can trigger you to strive to be the best you can be. My grandfather was
an immigrant from Denmark. He moved to Canada in his early twenties and
started a business. He soon got married and had a family and in my opinion had
made it. I strive to one day accomplish such feats in my own life. Elderly
generations can offer some of the greatest inspiration in our lives.
 In conclusion, There is great wisdom behind that weathered and wrinkled
face. It is just waiting to be tapped into and this can only be accomplished
through positive connections. So make sure to speak with the older generations
and let them offer you advice and stories of the past. It will better your life or
maybe even one day save your life."
"It was a long walk up the hill to where my Great Grandmother had just
moved. I was reluctant walking up that hill because I wasn’t sure as to whether I
would like what I saw when I got to the top of it. Eventually I got to the top where
the gates to Providence Home was. This was not my Great Grandmother’s
house I grew up in, this was a care home for the elderly. Don’t get me wrong, it
was a well-respected care home, I wouldn’t let my grandmother live in a shabby
old age home. Although it was nice it wasn’t my Big Nonna’s house.
 I walked into the premises to find the woman that I wished to even be half
of one day. The receptionist led me to the room where she was watching ‘The
Price is Right.’ There sat my Great Grandmother with a look of confusion on her
face. It had gotten worse, the Alzheimers. I was looking into the deep blue eyes
of my Grandmother but she was looking into the eyes of a stranger.
 Words weren’t exchanged because my Grandmother no longer spoke
thanks to the alzheimers. So I did what I did everytime I came to see my Big
Nonna, I read to her. Sometimes I read the paper, sometimes stories from
Chicken Soup, and other times just from magazines. It was the least I could do
for the woman who had a big part in raising me. I read and my Grandmother
listened. Even though I never got any feedback, I knew she was listening.
 Every week before and after that day I donated those two hours to my Big
Nonna. No matter how boring and painful it was to sit there, no matter how many
times I read the same stories, I wouldn’t give it up for the world. I know my not
only my Grandmother, but I will always remember the memories that I made with
her. "
"Our elders can contribute to the success that we have in the future of our
lives. Our connections with older generations can determine our lives because
we lack what they have, and that is experience. Positive connections with older
generations can enrich our lives because they are able to fill us in with the
knowledge that we lack. Sometimes, without this knowledge from our elders, we
may never go as far as we would like because we do not have that extra
knowledge of their experiences earlier in life.
 Our connections with our elders or superiors can really enrich our live.
Positive connections with our elders allows us to be enriched with their past and
that past is their experience which can really help us succeed in life. For
example, when I worked at a retail store, I was the the new employee. I knew
that everybody else had worked here longer than I have. Everyday, I would go
through my routine, and sell glasses and clean up when the store had no
customers. One day, there was this customer who was really difficult, she took
me around in circles and in the end did not buy anything. During my break, my
co-worker who had worked in the retail store for nearly ten years asked me how
my day was going. I told him about the customer and he filled me in on tips in
how to tell whether the customer was going to purchase items or not through
their actions and conversation. That piece of information was vital for me and
from then on, my job became much easier. My co-worker and I still work
together and we have a good relationship. He fills me in on his experiences
during his years of work and I gain alot from his past. His experiences make my
work so much easier.
 On the other hand, negative or no connection with our elders can take our
success only so far. For example if in a big company, one does not get along
with his or her colleagues, it may end up in disaster. This is because one can
only go so far with their knowledge in school. The rest is up to connections and
experiences. Experience from our elders can take us alot further than knowledge
from school. Lack of experience will lead to disaster or less success. Disaster
may come because sometimes, plans that we believe may go through
sometimes is the plan his or her boss despises, and with experience from our
elders, we are able to prevent from getting on the wrong side of our employer.
Negative or no connections with our elders will never take anyone far in life. "
"The most important thing in my life is my family. My family is my solid rock
of support, my greatest influence and my greatest conflict. Each person in my
mighty oak of a family tree has helped shape who I am through my own
experiences with them, experiences they have relayed to me, and wisdom they
pass on. My positive connections with these older generations have greatly
enriched my life.
 My mother and my grandmother are two very headstrong women that
have had a huge impact on me. My grandmother taught me the value of being a
lady and how important it is for me to keep it that way. My mother has taught me
how to be insightful and ambitious, and to challenge every statement and idea
ever said. It is unimaginable for me to even contemplate what my life would be
like without them.
 My grandmother was a working woman in a time that this was considered
to be preposterous. She taught me that a woman is her own person: never let
anyone else control you. My grandmother had this theory that she liked to call
“mad money”. Whenever my grandfather made her angry, she would take the
sum of money, unbeknownst to him she had been saving, and go away for the
night or however long she felt necessary. To this day she still goes by the same
policy.
 My mother is a defender of the weak. She feels the need to provide for
everybody and help wherever she is able. This was very beneficial to me and my
brother while we were growing up. Perhaps through genetics or through
experience I have inherited this trait, but because of her I too feel this need. My
mother helped me create my own mission statement: Defend the dignity of every
man, and to go sleep every night with a clear conscience. Two attributes that I
value.
 Not only have the older generations of my family taught me the “how-to’s”
of life, but they have also taught me the value of tradition and morals. I accredit
my high standards to these people, as well as what I hold dear to my heart. I
would not value what I value had it not been for their influence. Part of the
reason my family is so important is because my mother has taught me that they
are important. She has always told me that “blood is thicker than water”.
 I feel that the positive connections that I have had with people such as my
mother and my grandmother have enriched my life. I have been engulfed in love
and wisdom and I will never forget or regret these relationships. It is because of
my history that I can have a future. "
"What is the benefit of having grandparents? Those frail, antique
individuals seem fragile, and even mysterious at times. Their long, menacing
canes, and glittering mouth pieces watch our every move. But before we escape
the panic, we might want to discover the shocking truth.
 Grandparents are soft, loving creatures inside their wrinkly shell live wise
souls and cheerful spirits. Believe it or not, our predecessors have far more
understanding than we do. Years of challenges, hardships and obstacles have
sharpened their minds to a crystalline quality. Their knowledge surpasses even
the large brains of our parents. When we are in a sticky situation, it is always a
wise idea to travel back in time a ways. Grandparents, when needed, can
provide more useful advice than the “magical” internet of our era. Although our
grandparents may experience inconvenient gliches and viruses we can always
rely on their never ending love, and source of information.
 Inside each of our grandparents, there is a lively spirit. Behind Grandpa’s
thick reading glasses, there are twinkling, smiling, eyes and behind Grandma’s
knitted apron, there is a pocket full of candy. Although it may seem hard to
believe, Grandpa and Grandma are teenagers at heart. For as long as they live,
they will never cease to sing in the bath or dance in the rain. Along with their
furry miniature critters, our dear grandparents enrich our lives and provide us
with comfort.
 Has the truth sunk in? The wise, playful phenomenas we are lucky to call
grandparents benefit us in many ways. They connect us to the past, strengthen
us in the present, and contribute to a brighter future. Grandparents are
unpolished gems, waiting to be discovered by a privilidged miner. They are
twinkling starts of magic and warm sun rays of love. Without these priceless
creatures of the older generations, our fragile world would break apart. "
"In a bitter fight in cold November, Paul left home. His mother closed the
door behind him. His father didn’t know that he left until the weekend, when a
neighbour finally called to let him know. He hadn’t seen his son in three years
anyway. So, sixteen years old and with nothing but a suitcase and three hundred
dollars, Paul caught a train to Boston, because he knew that New York was too
far.
 Paul got a job as a dishwasher, then as a waiter, then as a host, and
finally, through a combination of luck, sharp with and good timing, Paul became
the manager. That took eighteen years. Paul turned thirty-four in the company
of his fiancé and several good friends that he made. His mother saw the date on
the calendar, but she didn’t send a card. Even if she had bought one, she
wouldn’t have known where to send it.
 As a treat to himself and his fiancé, Paul bought tow tickets to London that
summer. It would be his first time off the continent, indeed is first trip of notable
distance since he caught the train to Boston. The trip was a wonderful
experience for Paul, but he didn’t feel entirely right. Paul had stability, love,
money, friends, but it was in London that he found the missing piece of himself.
 He went alone to an enormous museum in the city (his fiancé preferred to
shop that day). He was impressed by the paintings, and mystified by the
sculptures. He happened upon one particulary intriguing exibit in the Historical
Anthropology section. The fossilized remains of a mother, father, and child,
embedded deep into the Earth lay in front of him. Crushed by a great earthquake
in modern-day Turkey, the family perished in tight embrace and remained in that
position forever. The sign told Paul that the family was now eight hundred years
old, three of thousands of victims of the murderous tremor. Their bones
intermingled in a desperate grasp, Paul was struck by the epitome of love, and
he realized the missing component of his soul.
 Back in Boston, for the first time in eighteen years, Paul called home.
 “It’s Paul.”
 “Paul. Paul where are you?”
 “In Boston. I’m getting married in November. I mailed you an invitation.”
 “Oh Paul, of course I’ll be there…”
 Paul’s father died eight years earlier, and he never really mended the
relationship with his mother, but Paul knew that he found a piece of himself that
he would never lose again.
 On a cold night in sweet November, Paul got married. "
"The fabric of an old shirt against my palm felt as soft and wrinkly as my
father’s face when he hit me. He looked at me, and I left. I walked across town,
the soles of my feet bare and tough in the loose sand and warm cement.
 I went to see a lady whose home was heavy with the powdery smell of old
age and quite nights. I had hated this smell when my ratty prison of a highschool
sentenced all seniors to thirty hours of community service. Now it was my
refuge.
 She was standing on the back porch, numbly buttering the freshly
laundered shirts of a husband who did not recognize her. Her hands were maps
of veins and age sports; roads I have not yet travelled. Stories I have not yet
heard. She stopped when she saw me, scalp tensing as she studied the cracks
in my skin from the salt of my tears. We didn’t say much.
 I helped her fold the laundry, and separate wooden clothespins from
plaotic ones. The air buzzed slightly with the slight scent of soapy anticipation
and freshly mown grass. The blue basket contained light spring blankets, almost
identical to the ones in which I had during childhood, enveloping myself in a
cocoon of lavender scent.
 We went inside the home for a drink. The lemonade was too sour, and
the ice burned my lips. She looked at me from across the bale, with eyes like
cloudy oysters with pears of wisdom. An old Johnny Cash song was playing, but
I could tell where it was from.
 “Four strong words that blow lonely, even seas that run high, all those
things that don’t’ change, come what may…”
 The music swirled like socks in a dryer. An engine started somewhere in
the distance.
 I could see myself in those eyes. My hands will someday become those
hands. All the ecstactes and pains I have experienced will be etched in the lines
of my face in the form of cryptic codes for teenagers to decipher. My palms were
hot and I wanted to laugh or throw up.
 “But the good times are all gone, and I’m bound for wrong on…”
 We were just doing laundry, after all. "
